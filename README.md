#   Recipe Site Traffic Analysis

    This project analyzes recipe data from the Tasty Bytes website to predict which recipes are likely to generate high traffic. The goal is to help the website optimize recipe selection for their homepage to increase overall traffic and user engagement.

    ##  Installation

    The code for this project is written in Python and can be run in a Jupyter Notebook environment (e.g., JupyterLab, Google Colab).

    **Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
    ```

    ##  Data Source

    The data for this analysis was provided by Tasty Bytes and contains information about recipes, including nutritional information and traffic data.

    ##  Code

    The main analysis is performed in the `recipe_traffic_analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

    ##  Analysis Summary

    The analysis involved data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the development and evaluation of machine learning models (XGBoost and SVM) to predict high-traffic recipes.

    ##  Key Findings

    The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model performed best in predicting high-traffic recipes. Key factors influencing recipe traffic include \[list a few important features\].

    ##  Files Included

    -   `recipe_traffic_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the code.

    ##  Usage

    To run the analysis, open the `recipe_traffic_analysis.ipynb` notebook and execute the cells.
