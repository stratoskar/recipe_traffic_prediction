#   **Recipe Traffic Prediction for Tasty Bytes**

    This project focuses on predicting recipe traffic for the _Tasty Bytes_ website. The primary objective is to develop a model that can accurately forecast which recipes will attract high user traffic, enabling the website to optimize its homepage content and, consequently, increase overall user engagement and drive subscription growth. This analysis was conducted as part of a **DataCamp Professional Data Scientist Certification** practical exam.

    You can find the project instructions and the code in this repository.

    ##  1.  **Project Description**

    This project addresses the challenge of predicting recipe traffic for the _Tasty Bytes_ website. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can effectively determine which recipes are likely to be popular and drive high traffic. The analysis involves a comprehensive workflow, including:

    * **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, converting data types, and encoding categorical variables.
    * **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions and relationships to gain insights.
    * **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features to potentially improve model predictive power.
    * **Model Development and Evaluation:** Training and evaluating machine learning models (XGBoost and SVM) to predict high traffic.

    The successful implementation of such a model can provide valuable insights for content placement on the Tasty Bytes homepage, leading to increased user engagement and subscription rates.

    ##  2.  **Dependencies**

    The project is implemented in Python 3.x and requires the following libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
    ```

    It is highly recommended to use a Jupyter Notebook environment (e.g., JupyterLab, Google Colab) to execute the code.

    ##  3.  **Data Information**

    The dataset used in this analysis was provided by Tasty Bytes. It comprises recipe-related information, including:

    * Nutritional details (calories, carbohydrate, sugar, protein)
    * Recipe category
    * Serving size
    * An indicator representing high traffic

    ##  4.  **Code Overview**

    The main codebase for this project is the Jupyter Notebook: `recipe_traffic_prediction_analysis.ipynb`

    This notebook contains all the code for data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

    ##  5.  **Analysis Summary**

    The analysis process can be summarized as follows:

    1.  **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values and prepare the data for analysis.
    2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** EDA techniques were used to understand the distribution of variables and relationships between them.
    3.  **Feature Engineering:** New features were created to potentially improve the predictive power of the models.
    4.  **Model Development:** Machine learning models (XGBoost and SVM) were trained to predict high-traffic recipes.
    5.  **Model Evaluation:** The performance of the models was evaluated using appropriate metrics.

    ##  6.  **How to Run the Code**

    To execute the analysis:

    1.  Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed.
    2.  Install the required libraries using pip:
        ```bash
        pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
        ```
    3.  Open the `recipe_traffic_prediction_analysis.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment (JupyterLab or Google Colab).
    4.  Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

    ##  7.  **Author Information**

    This analysis was conducted by **Efstratios Karkanis** as part of the DataCamp Professional Data Scientist Certification.
